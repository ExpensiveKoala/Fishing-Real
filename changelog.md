- Redid the way Fabric fish conversion is handled to add more support for custom fishing loot tables. I.E. Mods like Sandwichable
- Added Aquaculture 2 rod support. Double hook can actually hook two fish, and bait is properly consumed!
- Added support for stack size on forge. If you fish up an itemstack with more than 1 size, it will spawn that many fish
- Update to 1.20.1
